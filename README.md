#LessCSS Mixins

This is a collection of simple LessCSS Mixins that I have built up from past projects that I have worked on. These mixins have saved me loads of time since I started the list, allowing me to quickly implement common CSS3 features without needing to worry about any of the various vendor prefixes.

#Usage

Using the mixins is a piece of cake. If you don't know what mixins are or how to use them, you can find out more <a href="http://lesscss.org/features/#mixins-feature" target="_blank">here</a>.

The current list of mixins is as follows:

- borderRadius
- borderTopRadius
- borderRightRadius
- borderBottomRadius
- borderLeftRadius
- boxShadow
- insetBoxShadow
- gradientLeftRight
- gradientTopBottom
- placeholderColor
- textShadow
- transition

Enjoy!
